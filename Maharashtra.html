and trousers or shalwar kameez with the traditionally nauvari or nine-yard lugade, disappearing from the markets due to a lack of demand. Maharashtra's regional literature is about lives and circumstances of Marathi
 people in specific parts of the state. The Marathi language, which boasts a rich literary heritage, is written in the Devanagari script. The earliest instances of Marathi literature is by Sant Dnyaneshwar with his Bhawarthadeepika 
 (popularly known as Dnyaneshwari). </br></br>

In recent decades, Marathi Tamasha has been also been incorporated in some experimental plays.</br></br>
