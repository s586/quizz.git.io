2.	Varanasi </br></br>
Varanasi, also known as Kashi and Benaras and considered to be the world’s oldest living city is one of the most famous tourist places in Uttar Pradesh. Being one of Hinduism’s seven holy cities, Varanasi is indeed the spiritual capital of India.
While you would find temples at almost every turn in the city, the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, which is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas, is the most visited and the oldest of all.  The ceremony of immense grandeur and spiritual enlightenment, the Ganga Aarti is a must-experience when in Varanasi.</br></br>
3.	Vrindavan </br></br>
 Vrindavan is considered to be one of the most important places of pilgrimage for the devotees of Lord Krishna. Considered to be his childhood abode, the city of Vrindavan, which is located along the waters of river Yamuna hosts hundreds of Lord Krishna and Radha temples scattered throughout.
 The most famous of them are Banke Bihari temple and the world-famous ISKCON temple. The name of the city has been derived from Vrinda (meaning basil) and Van (meaning grove) which perhaps refer to the two small groves at Nidhivan and Seva Kunj. Since Vrindavan is considered to be a sacred place, a large number of people come here to renounce their worldly life.
Being the birthplace of Lord Krishna makes Mathura one of Hinduism’s seven sacred cities and therefore attracts a horde of pilgrims from all over the world, making it one of the most visited pilgrims and tourist places in Uttar Pradesh</br></br>

history, literature and culture. The people of Lucknow are known for their courtly manners and endearing ‘Pehle aap’ (you first) culture, which always leaves behind a smile on the faces of the visitors. Rumi Darwaza, the Mughal Gateway built in the centre of the capital divides the city into its old and new part. 
While Old Lucknow is well-known for its bustling vibrant streets, authentic mouth-watering kebab and biryani outlets, Lucknowi Chikan (a form of embroidery) market and wholesale jewellery stores, New Lucknow hosts people of varied cultures,
is urban and one of the most planned cities in Asia. Lucknow is certainly one of the most famous places not only in Uttar Pradesh but also in the whole of India.</br></br>

Prayagraj,is famous for Triveni Sangam or the meeting points of three rivers – Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati and therefore one of the important tourist spots to visit in Uttar Pradesh. Built on the site of the ancient town of Prayag,
Allahabad has, since time immemorial, held the largest Hindu gathering on the banks of the Sangam – the Maha Kumbh Mela, which is held here every twelve years and is attended by millions of pilgrims from across the globe. Prayag or Prayagraj had been the ancient name of the city,
however, after the Mughal invasion, Emperor Akbar, impressed by the location named the city ‘Ilahabas which meant ‘Abode of God’. Emperor Shah Jahan, his grandson, renamed the city to Allahabad. Other popular places to visit in Allahabad include the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Allahabad Fort;
Anand Bhavan – the ancestral home of the Nehrus; All Saints Cathedral;  Chandra Shekhar Azad Park; and Allahabad Museum among others.</br></br>
